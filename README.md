I'm currently working on the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  
- Learning Python, SQL, and R for data analysis.  
- Exploring tools like Jupyter Notebooks, RStudio, and Git.  
- Applying the CRISP-DM framework to real-world case studies.  

So far, Iâ€™ve completed **50% of the course** and built an exploratory data analysis project using Python. Excited to dive deeper into machine learning and big data!
