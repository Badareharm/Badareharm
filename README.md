I'm currently working on the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate** on Coursera.  
- Learning Python for data analysis.  
- Exploring tools like Jupyter Notebooks and RStudio.    

So far, I‚Äôve completed **50% of the course** and built an exploratory data analysis project using Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Projects I've Worked On

Here are some of the exciting projects I've developed:

- **Mathematical GUI Software**  
  A Python and Tkinter-based software that simplifies complex mathematical calculations with an interactive graphical interface.

- **GUI MySQL Workbench**  
  A custom MySQL Workbench built using Python, SQL, Tkinter, and CustomTkinter (CTk). It provides a user-friendly interface for database operations, including querying, editing, and managing MySQL databases.

These projects have helped me strengthen my programming, GUI design, and database management skills. I'm passionate about solving real-world problems with intuitive and efficient tools!
